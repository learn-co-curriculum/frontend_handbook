# Frontend Handbook

## Learning Goals

- Recognize gaps in knowledge of Frontend programming
- Find resources for next learning steps

## Gap Analysis

You are on your journey towards mastery of software development. Ownership of your journey includes knowing what you know and what you don't know.

Frontend Masters' [Frontend Handbook](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/) is a compendium of overviews and resources for mastering frontend development. It doesn't make a great end-to-end read, because it's mostly made of links to other resources. Instead, as you page through the readings and resources, you should maintain lists: "Things I know" and "Things I don't know". From the list of things you don't know, you can bucket things into "Things I want to learn" and "Things I'm fine not learning". Next, prioritize the areas of your learning, and use the handbook as a reference for learning in those areas according to your priorities.

Reading (scanning) this book and compiling your lists should take about 2 hours. Mastering frontend development will take a few years.
